# Unity VR Experiments

:sparkles: This is me, learning to do VR using Unity :sparkles:

## Project

For as long as is feasible, this repo will contain just one Unity project, with the different experiments being implemented as different scenes. This will hopefully encourage me to re-use code between scenes, and to eventually end up with a body of common code that can be used to seed other projects.

At time of writing  Unity 2020.3.24f1 is being used.

Relevant XR package versions are:

 * XR Interaction Toolkit 2.0.1
 * XR Plugin Management 4.2.1

## License

This code should be considered to be in the public domain.
